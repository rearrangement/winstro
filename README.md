<h2>Getting Started</h2>
</div>
To be able to run and make changes to your own version, follow this short tutorial.

First, you could either download the `winstro.ps1` script from the repo and run it, or you can clone the script and run it from there for an easy setup.

If you want to clone it, follow these commands
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rearrangement/winstro winstro
cd winstro
.\winstro.ps1\
```

Once you have run these commands, you can now run

`bun run main`

This will allow you to start a local development server where you can make changes and see those changes LOCALLY.

<h2>Contributing</h2>
</div>

You can contribute to the repository by simply making a pull request to this repository with the proposed changes that you'd like to make.

Please make sure to update the changelog, if not it's alright but it saves us a little bit of time when reviewing the pull requests.

Most of these pull requests will be reviewed by the repositories maintainers, (just me, rearrangement as of now) and your request will either be merged or declined most likely with a reason to our decision.

All ideas and changes are welcome, don't be scared to contribute. This does not say that all ideas will be accepted though.

<div align="center">
<h2>Licensing</h2>
</div>

You are allowed to do anything that the license to this software permits, no matter what happens to the software. Even if this goes private and you repost it, you are 100% allowed to do so.

There are some companies that license their software and then revoke it with no announcement (iykyk). The license that you get with this software will contain the set of rules of what you are allowed and not allowed to do with it. This license will always be valid no matter what.

<div align="center">
<h2>Security</h2>
</div>

If there are security issues with MY code (NOT other packages that this code relies on), please follow the instructions in [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/rearrangement/winstro/blob/main/SECURITY.md) on how to report them and whatnot.
